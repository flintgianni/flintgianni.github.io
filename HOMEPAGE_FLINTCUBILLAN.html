    <p>It's truly inspiring to see Filipino artists and designers abroad finally reach their major breakthrough... and it's even better when they get to tell their personal stories. Blush, an animated short film animated by Joe Mateo, a Filipino seasoned animator and storyboard artist working in the United States, is one such example.</p>
	<p>This 15-minute film is his first as a writer and filmmaker, and it is based on his own experiences. He came up with the idea while grieving the loss of his wife, Mary Ann, who died of breast cancer in 2017. Another inspiration is their shared experience of relocating to a new country.</p>

    <p>Christmas begins early (even before Halloween), so you can get into the festive spirit right away. Lacey Chabert, Tamera Mowry-Housley, Alison Sweeney, Kelly Rowland, Candace Cameron Bure, Melissa Joan Hart, Chad Michael Murray, and Kristoffer Polaha are among the constant faces. There are also mini-get-together of stars from The Brady Bunch, Back to the Future, The Wonder Years, and Desperate Housewives. A RuPaul film featuring a slew of Drag Race queens has been released.Yes, there are a lot of imaginary boyfriends, royal princesses, stranded snowstorms, and things that need to be rescued. What exactly is it? Is it possible to spend less time talking and more time receiving gifts? Let's get this party started!</p>
